hidden → Extra content is cut off and not shown.

scroll → Always shows scrollbars, even if not needed.

auto → Shows scrollbars only when content overflows.

It has 4 parts:

property → What you want to animate (like color, width, etc.)

duration → How long the animation takes (like 0.5s)

timing-function → The speed style (like ease, linear, etc.)

delay → Wait time before the animation starts

Different functions of transform:

translate → Moves the element left/right or up/down

scale → Makes the element bigger or smaller

rotate → Rotates the element by a certain angle
